                            muscles.
                            Yet it’s often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Its classic symptoms are widespread muscle
                            and joint pain and fatigue. </p>


                        <p class="white-text">It’s associated with widespread pain in the muscles and bones, areas of
                            tenderness, and general fatigue. Symptoms like these are considered subjective, meaning they
                            can’t be determined or measured by tests.
                            Because its symptoms are subjective and there isn’t a clear known cause, fibromyalgia is
                            often misdiagnosed as another disease,
                            it is characterised by chronic widespread pain and allodynia (a heightened and painful
                            response to pressure).
                        </p>
                        <p class="white-text">The lack of reproducible, objective tests for this disorder plays a role
                            in some doctors questioning the disorder altogether. Although it’s more widely accepted in
                            medical circles now than previously, some doctors and researchers don’t consider
                            fibromyalgia a real condition

                            which stems from a struggle in gaining acceptance for painful symptoms.
                        </p>
                        <p class="white-text">Fibromyalgia is often associated with areas of tenderness, which are
                            called trigger points or tender points. These are places on your body where even light
                            pressure can cause pain.
                        </p>
                        <p class="white-text">Today, these points are rarely used to diagnose fibromyalgia. Instead,
                            they may be used as one way for doctors to narrow their list of possible diagnoses.
                            Doctors use a combination of other consistent symptoms — and possibly some medical tests —
                            to help them determine a cause.
                        </p>
                        <p class="white-text">The pain caused by these trigger points can also be described as a
                            consistent dull ache affecting many areas of your body.
                            If you were to experience this pain for at least three months, doctors may consider this a
                            symptom of fibromyalgia.
                        </p>
                        <p class="white-text">Symptoms may be a result of the brain and nerves misinterpreting or
                            overreacting to normal pain signals.
                            This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain.</p>

                            Instead, doctors may make a diagnosis if you report widespread pain for more than three
                            months and have no diagnosable medical condition that can explain the pain.

                            <p class="white-text">Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with psychiatric conditions such
                                as depression and anxiety and stress-related disorders such as post traumatic stress
                                disorder.
                                Not all people with fibromyalgia experience all associated symptoms.
                                The defining symptoms of fibromyalgia are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep
                                disturbance,
                                and heightened pain in response to tactile pressure (allodynia).</p>

                            <p class="white-text">Other symptoms may include tingling of the skin, prolonged muscle
                                spasms, weakness in the limbs,
                                nerve pain, muscle twitching, palpitations, and functional bowel disturbances.
                                Many patients experience cognitive dysfunction (known as “Fibro Fog”), which may be
                                characterised by impaired concentration,
                                problems with short and long-term memory, short-term memory consolidation, impaired
                                speed of performance, inability to multi-task,
                                cognitive overload and diminished attention span.</p>
