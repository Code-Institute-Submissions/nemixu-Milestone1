                                    Fibromyalgia is the second most common condition affecting your bones and muscles.
                                    Yet it’s often misdiagnosed and misunderstood. Its classic symptoms are widespread muscle and joint pain and fatigue.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    It’s associated with widespread pain in the muscles and bones, areas of tenderness, and general fatigue. Symptoms like these are considered subjective, meaning they can’t be determined or measured by tests. Because its symptoms are subjective and there isn’t a clear known cause, fibromyalgia is often misdiagnosed as another disease.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    Fibromyalgia is characterised by chronic widespread pain and allodynia (a heightened and painful response to pressure).</p>
                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    The lack of reproducible, objective tests for this disorder plays a role in some doctors questioning the disorder altogether. Although it’s more widely accepted in medical circles now than previously, some doctors and researchers don’t consider fibromyalgia a real condition.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    According to the Mayo Clinic, this can increase your risk of depression, which stems from a struggle in gaining acceptance for painful symptoms.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    Fibromyalgia is often associated with areas of tenderness, which are called trigger points or tender points. These are places on your body where even light pressure can cause pain.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    Today, these points are rarely used to diagnose fibromyalgia. Instead, they may be used as one way for doctors to narrow their list of possible diagnoses. Doctors use a combination of other consistent symptoms — and possibly some medical tests — to help them determine a cause.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    The pain caused by these trigger points can also be described as a consistent dull ache affecting many areas of your body. If you were to experience this pain for at least three months, doctors may consider this a symptom of fibromyalgia.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    Symptoms may be a result of the brain and nerves misinterpreting or overreacting to normal pain signals. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain.</p>

                                    <p class="white-text">
                                    What are Trigger Points?
                                    A person used to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia if they had widespread pain and tenderness in at least 11 of the known 18 trigger points. Doctors would check to see how many of these points were painful by pressing firmly on them.</p>

                                            <strong>Common trigger points include:</strong>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>back of the head</li>

                                            <li>tops of shoulders</li>

                                            <li>upper chest</li>

                                            <li>hips</li>

                                            <li>knees</li>

                                            <li>inner elbows</li> </ul>

                                            Trigger points are no longer the focus of diagnosis for fibromyalgia.

                                            Instead, doctors may make a diagnosis if you report widespread pain for more than three months and have no diagnosable medical condition that can explain the pain.
